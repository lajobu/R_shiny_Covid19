## :star: Description:

This project was made together with Noam Shmuel. 

As the world is in the midst of a once in a `century pandemic phase`, it would be natural for `Data Science students` to look closely into the data which is being generated on a daily basis.

The aim of our project would be to be an `interactive web application` which will visualize different variables such as, new cases discovered, tests, recoveries and more. Ordered by country and time as per the userâ€™s request.

During the process of creating the `Shiny app` we would clean, filter and merge the data to fit our needs. This step would incorporate tools which we have learned during the course, such as `dplyr` and `tidyr`, even `creating functions`. This process will be presented as a `R-markdown file`.
